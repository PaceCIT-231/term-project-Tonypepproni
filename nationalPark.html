            <p>National parks are the most popular sites in the park system.
                They usally offer amazing views of nature that are unique to their location.
                This excludes the shameful Gateway Arch national park. This was made a park
                just on poltics and is a disgusting mess. They also offer historical information
                and exhibits. They can only be made by an act of congress.
